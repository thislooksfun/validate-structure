## [2.0.0](https://github.com/thislooksfun/validate-structure/compare/v1.3.0...v2.0.0) (2021-06-23)


### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* The 'any' matcher no longer matches `null` or
`undefined`. To get the old behavior back, use 'any?' instead.
* The function addPathToMsg() has been renamed to
buildError() to better reflect what it actually does.
* ValidationError.type was optional for backwards
compatibility. It is now required.
* ValidationError.path has been changed from a string
to an array. This fixes the issue of having keys with dots in them
and also allows for easier machine processing of the path for a given
error message.
